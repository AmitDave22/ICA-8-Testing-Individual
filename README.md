#Problem Description

To write a Test-Driven Development program to find the number of empty urinals from each of the binary strings.

My goal here was to create 2 files:

1. urinals.java : To create all of the logic about determining the number of empty urinals and reading the file and handling the objects.

2. urinalsTest.java : To write all unit tests and handle exceptional cases
